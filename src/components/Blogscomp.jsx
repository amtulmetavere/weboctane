    content: "14 Trends That Are Currently Impacting the Future of Work\nEven though we didn’t expect the future of work to come so quickly, the shift to remote work and the emergence of virtual workplaces is forcing us to adapt to these changes.\n \nFor employers that decide to keep their centralized workspaces, the office of tomorrow will be designed to keep people connected while they are physically apart. We are expecting to see the rise of virtual work spaces in order to enable employees for success and keep their productivity levels high.\n \nLet’s now take a look into some emerging trends that have brought what we used to call the future of work faster than expected.\n\n1. Remote work as the new normal way of working\nYou may remember the saying: “The future of work is remote!” It is just unbelievable to see how fast the future of work actually became the new normal, isn’t it?\n\nAt the beginning of this crisis, many organizations thought that remote work was impossible for them to handle as Talent Management practices have been completely disrupted. However, this is not the case as many of them are considering keeping remote work options even after this pandemic.\n\n68% of CFOs say crisis-driven transitions to remote work will make their company better in the long run. Currently, 40% of companies say they’re planning to accelerate the adoption of new ways of working.\n\nAlso, many organizations understand that, with the return to the workplaces, the way we work will still be significantly different than it was a few months ago.\n\nIt is crucial for employers to adapt to new employee behaviors and new ways of working that make the most sense for their workplaces.\n\n2. Accelerated digital transformations\nMany organizations will remember 2020 as the year of digital transformation. Digitalizing both internal and external processes today is essential for businesses to keep running as smoothly as possible.\n\nTools and software solutions for employee communication are at the top of the list when it comes to implementing new digital solutions within the workplaces. Such solutions are essential to keep employees connected and informed about the important and, now more than ever before, frequent company updates as well as updates from the local authorities.\n\n📚 Also check our article on Organizational Communication and 9 Steps to Do it Right.\n\nHowever, as digital transformation has never been an easy process to go through, many organizations are struggling to align their workplaces and get employees’ support when it comes to the adoption of the new workplace technologies.\n\nTherefore, proper employee communication plays an extremely important role in this process especially now when social distancing is still recommended.",
